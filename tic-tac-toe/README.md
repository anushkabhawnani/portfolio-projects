# Tic-Tac-Toe

A text based Python Tic-Tac-Toe Game that involves two players.

## How it Works

The game alternates between the users, accepting responses for the co-ordinates for the row and column that the user wishes to place their pawn in.

The position of the pawns are stored in lists which get those values to check if there is a strike in any row or column. 

There are also stored values for diagonals which the program checks if there has been a diagonal strike. If any of these conditions work then the game ends and either of the players are declared winner.

If all the places are filled with no winner, then the game is declared draw.
