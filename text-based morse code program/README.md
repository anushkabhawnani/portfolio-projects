# Morse Code Program

A very simple text based Morse Code Program that converts an input string by the user into morse code

## Use

Don't we all love talking in code? This program helps us be secretive so that the FBI can't track us talking to our friends about teenager gossip.

## How it Works

The user inputs a string into the program. For every character in the string, the program matches it with the key in the morse code dictionary. It returns the value of the value of the key that it matches with and stores it in a list.

For every space or character not present in the dictionary, it stores the character as is.

The list is then converted into a string and then displayed to the user.
