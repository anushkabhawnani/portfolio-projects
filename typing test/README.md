# Typing Test

A Python GUI Program that uses tkinter to check the speed and accuracy of a user's typing skills to calculate WPM of the user.

## Use

You need a really high WPM to get certain jobs. With the help of this code, you can practice your typing speed by typing commonly used words at a really fast pace with high accuracy to gain a high typing score.

## How it Works

This code gets words randomly from a text file and displays it to the user once they click on 'Start'. The code checks once the word has been matched by the input. If it has then the score increases and if it doesn't then the user needs to keep trying till it does match.
