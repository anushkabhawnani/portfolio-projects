# Image Watermarking App

A Python GUI that watermarks an image from the user with the text of their choice and downloads it onto their computer.

## Use

It is very important to watermark your content with the rise of theft on the internet. This app provides that in a simple format with basic readable font and a simple yet cohesive user interface.

## How it Works

Using modules like tkinter and pillow, the code accepts an image from the user and a text that you want to watermark on the desired image.

The text is then tilted at an angle and placed in the center of the image, once done, the image is then downloaded to a file path which is displayed when the code is run.
